# Trendies - Referral System Feature

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the **Referral System** feature for the Trendies marketplace platform.

The referral system tracks user signups using a `?ref=ID` query parameter in the URL. When a new user registers via a referral link, the referrer‚Äôs ID is saved and associated with the new user, enabling tracking of referral activity and potential rewards in the future.

## Live Demo

Access the live deployment here:  
[https://trendies-referral-web.vercel.app](https://trendies-referral-web.vercel.app/)

Note: For the best experience when testing the referral flow, I recommend using an incognito/private browser window to avoid cookie/session conflicts during sign-up.

## Feature Details

### How It Works

1. **Referral Link**  
   Users can copy and share a unique referral link from there dashboard containing their user ID, e.g.:

   ```text
   https://trendiesmaroc.com/signup?code=1234

2. **Referral Tracking**  
  When a new visitor lands on the signup page with a ?code=ID query parameter, the referral ID is saved in a cookie
  
3. **User Signup**  
During signup, the backend reads the stored referral ID from the request and associates it with the new user record

4. **Referral Attribution**  
The referral ID is stored on the new user‚Äôs database record as referredBy, enabling tracking.

    Add initial products directly in your DB or create a seeder.
   ```

5. **5. Run dev servers**
   ```sh
     In separate terminals:
   
     # API
        cd apps/api
        pnpm run dev
      
     # Frontend
        cd apps/web
        pnpm run dev
   ```

### How to Test the Referral System

1. Visit the signup page with a referral code, e.g.:
     ```http://localhost:3000/signup?ref=1234 ```
2. Complete the signup form.
3. Verify in the database that the new user record has the referredBy field set to the referrer‚Äôs user ID (1234 in this example).
